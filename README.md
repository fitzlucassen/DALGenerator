DALGenerator
============

Create all PHP classes to manage the databases entities

1) Put your configuration in config.inc.php

2) I'm used to use the class "sql.class.php" to manage my SQL queries. So the class I create will use its functions like "SelectTable", "Select" or "Query"

3) Just go to "localhost/DALGenerator/app.php" and enjoy your classes :)
