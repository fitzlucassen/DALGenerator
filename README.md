DALGenerator
============

Create all the DATA-ACCESS-LAYER classes to manage the databases entities

1) Set your configurations in app.php

2) I'm used to use the class "sql.class.php" to manage my SQL queries. So the class I create will use its functions like "SelectTable", "Select" or "Query"

3) Just go to "localhost/DALGenerator/app.php" and enjoy your classes :)
